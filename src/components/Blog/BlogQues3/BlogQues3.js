                Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property. You might be familiar with refs primarily as a way to access the DOM. If you pass a ref object to React with useRef(), React will set its .current property to the corresponding DOM node whenever that node changes.
                React hooks allow us to use state and other React features inside functional components — a huge improvement over managing state in class components. Perhaps not as popular as useState and useEffect, useRef is a nifty hook that has some important use cases.
